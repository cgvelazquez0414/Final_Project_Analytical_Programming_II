Hello, and welcome to our Final Project repository! My teammate, William Kilday, and I worked on a hypothetical scenario posed by Steam, where we addressed the following questions:
	1.	Is it possible to analyze customers’ emotions toward the games developed by the top five developers?
	2.	How feasible is it to predict whether a customer is likely to purchase a game, and what factors drive those decisions?
	3.	Are there alternative methods for collecting data on genres and categories?
	4.	What methods can be explored to group reviews based on common themes to better understand user feedback and preferences?

To answer the first question, we provided a sentiment score analysis based on the top five developers. 

For the second question, we utilized web scraping techniques to gather relevant data. 

To address the third question, we developed a neural network classification model and validated the results with a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model. 

For the fourth question, we presented a decision tree model and complemented the results by using a random forest to determine feature importance. 

Finally, we applied a K-means clustering model to identify the optimal number of clusters and demonstrated how reviews are grouped using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). 

We hope you enjoy our analysis. It has been an honor to learn and work through these models to develop meaningful insights and contribute to Steam’s ability to improve its games and user experience.
